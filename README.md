## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Learned a lot about DOM properties of JavaScript. Learned how to add gradient borders. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->
```css
input[type = "text"]:focus, input[type = "text"]:active, input[type = "text"]:hover {
    outline: none;
    border: 1px solid transparent;
    background-image: linear-gradient(var(--white), var(--white)), 
                      linear-gradient(to right, var(--linear-gradient-from), var(--linear-gradient-to));
    background-origin: border-box;
    background-clip: padding-box, border-box;
}
```
<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

Not happy with the responsiveness of the website right now. Had a hard time properly placing the contents of the card as well as the maintaining proper size of the cards for different screen sizes. I Will try to improve that.
